<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hi, I am Ayush Acharya, a Computer Science undergraduate at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra.</p>

<p>My interests include Software Development, Problem Solving and Data Structures & Algorithms. I have a good grip on my Computer Science fundamentals. I believe in writing clean and scalable code.</p>

<p>I am skilled in C/C++, Java (Basics), Javascript, Vue, Vuex, Nuxtjs, React, Redux, Nextjs, Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB with Mongoose and SQL. I have worked on several projects which are available on my GitHub account. While I've been engrossed in Web Development, I also enjoy working with Figma to improve UI/UX Design for my projects and create meaningful experiences for my clients. I have also interned as a Front-end Developer at Starvic and had a really meaningful experience working alongside the Founder and Tech Lead.</p>
