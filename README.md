<p>
    Hey there! I'm Ayush Acharya — a Software Engineer by profession.
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently, I’m part of the incredible team at Typeface, an AI-driven company where we're building smart, scalable solutions that make a real impact. Before this, I had the chance to grow and contribute at Adobe and Fastenal, where I deepened my understanding of building reliable, user-focused software.
    <br />
    <br />
    What drives me? Crafting clean, efficient, and scalable code — and the thrill of solving tough problems with simple, elegant solutions. I love digging into data structures and algorithms, and I’m always looking for smarter ways to build better products.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm also drawn to the creative side of tech. Whether it's wireframing in Figma or refining user flows, I enjoy designing intuitive experiences that feel just right. Freelancing has given me the chance to partner with some great people, bringing their ideas to life through thoughtful design and code.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you're passionate about tech, design, or just want to chat about ideas — let’s connect! I’m always up for a great conversation or a new collaboration.
